There are approximately $16^1802$ blog posts about sleeping on the floor on the internet. Well, here is one of them ;D. Prepare for some cringy section titles.

# The start of a journey
I was never really happy with my sleeping situation. Until I met sleeping on the floor™. The End.

No, for real though, I don't remember my sleeping comfort as a kid but I do remember it in my teens and it was kind of not great. My dad actually built a bed for me out of wood and the first mattress I got to chose for myself was quite hard and used to have frequent lower back pain after sleeping. It wasn't severe and usually left a few hours after getting up but it was there.

# Change
I remember being at my relative's and there weren't enough beds for everyone to sleep so somebody had to sleep on the couch. My father happened to be the chosen one but he deliberately decided to sleep on the floor because it would be good for his back, he said.

~~That got me thinking~~. No, it didn't. The story is true but it wasn't my motivation. So what _was_ my motivation to decide to sleep on the floor after all? 

# Motivation
[I didn't have any](). I just like to try something new from time to time, I guess. 
So I read up on sleeping on the floor. Turns out basically everyone has found a lot of enjoyment in it, I couldn't find a single review or blog post that concluded it was bad to try it. This really sounded too good to be true. 

You know, it's like how you can google basically any fruit or vegetable and find a million articles on how this antioxidant superfood is going to solve all your nutrition problems, prevent cancer, heal your cat's dementia. It even does your taxes, too! (ok maybe its not like that)

Futon time!

# Bonding Moments
I settled on a futon as a compromise first and really liked it but it was still too bed-y! After moving places, I did a switch to sleeping on a yoga mat. Its quite thin (about 1 centimeter) but oh boy I have never slept this well in my life. 

# Breakdance Feaver
I have been sleeping on the floor for maybe 5 months now and these are my conclusions.

Here are some advantages for me, personally:
- My back does not hurt in the morning
- It's easier for me to get up
- Sleeping feels more restful, especially because of the above point
- Yoga Mat: 20€, Proper Mattress: >500€ + Bed: ??€ 
- Space savings if you don't have a bed

Here are some disadvantages for me, personally:
- When laying on the side in a wrong position, my arms tend to get clamped off which can be a little unpleasant. When it gets too bad I fix it by using a thicker yoga mat
  - Maybe one should do these fancy indegenous sleeping positions like [this guy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119282/)
- I guess CO2 is heavier than air so maybe there is an air quality problem on the floor? :D (not noticeable bc I sleep) I might do some measurements in the future
- Beds can be a nice looking piece of furniture

Neutrals:
- Making your bed is about the same effort

# Finding Peace
So... Should you try sleeping on the floor? The answer is probably yes unless you are a koala bear.
